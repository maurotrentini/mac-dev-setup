# MacBook Dev Setup

This repository contains scripts to bootstrap and maintain my development environment on macOS.  
It automates the installation of command-line tools, apps, and utilities using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and keeps my Dock organized.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Included
- **setup.sh** â€“ Full one-time setup for a fresh Mac:
  - Installs Homebrew (if missing)
  - Installs CLI tools and GUI apps defined in `Brewfile`
  - Configures the Dock layout
- **refresh.sh** â€“ Safe re-run script for daily/weekly maintenance:
  - Updates Homebrew & installed apps
  - Reinstalls anything missing from `Brewfile`
  - Optionally (commented out) removes apps not listed in `Brewfile`
  - Resets & reconfigures the Dock
- **Brewfile** â€“ Single source of truth for installed apps/tools

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
